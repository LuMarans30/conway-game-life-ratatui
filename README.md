A Rust implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Created as part of a university exercise.

The program supports two modes:
- **Random universe generation** (configurable with a seed value)
- **Custom universe via parsing** from plaintext files

Parameters are configured via the CLI using the `clap` crate.
